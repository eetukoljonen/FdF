# FdF

This project is about creating a simple wireframe model representation of a 3D landscape by linking various points (x, y, z) thanks to line segments (edges) using our schools own graphic library minilibx. There is a subject file (fdf.pdf) if you want to learn more about the subject.

We have to follow our schools norme when coding.
Some basic norme rules:
- function can't exeed 25 lines
- no for loops
- no ternary operators

How to run this program?
- make
- ./fdf test_maps/*map_name*
